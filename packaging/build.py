"""Build the application, the installer, and the manifest the updater reads.

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -r packaging/requirements-build.txt
    python packaging/build.py

Three outputs land in `dist/`: the unpacked `FileManager/` folder, the
`FileManager-Setup-<version>.exe` that gets downloaded, and `latest.json`,
which is the file every installed copy fetches to find out a new version
exists. All three are release assets except the folder.

The one rule this file exists to enforce: **the build tool builds and `gh`
publishes, never both.** Redline PDF let its packager publish once per target,
two of them raced to create the same release, the loser's uploads were orphaned
and the update manifest never arrived -- and the run still exited green, so the
fault surfaced weeks later on a machine that could no longer update. Nothing
here touches the network. What it does instead is refuse to finish: a missing
installer, a manifest naming a file that is not there, or a version that
disagrees with `app/__init__.py` all stop the build, because every one of those
ships a release that cannot be updated to and says nothing about it.
