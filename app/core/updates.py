"""Finding out a new version exists, and installing it. The only network call.

Nothing else in this application talks to the internet, so everything here is
deliberately narrow: one GET of one small JSON file, at most once a launch
unless the user asks, and no download that was not agreed to.

**None of it runs on the UI thread.** The rule the rest of the application
follows for the filesystem holds twice over for a socket: a GET against an
unreachable host blocks for as long as the connect timeout, and a window that
stops painting because GitHub is slow is the same defect this application was
written to escape, arriving by a different route. The two workers below are
threads rather than processes because unlike a listing there is nothing here
that a hung SMB share can wedge -- the timeout is ours to set, the socket is
ours to close, and the only file touched is one we created in `%LOCALAPPDATA%`.

What is downloaded is checked against the size and the SHA-256 in the manifest,
and written to a `.part` file that is renamed onto the real name only once both
match -- the same discipline the transfer engine uses, for the same reason.
That proves the download arrived intact. It does not prove who built it: the
installer is unsigned, so the trust boundary is HTTPS to github.com and nothing
more. That is a choice rather than an oversight, written down here so it does
not quietly become one. Signing the installer is the upgrade path if this ever
runs on a machine that is not the author's.
